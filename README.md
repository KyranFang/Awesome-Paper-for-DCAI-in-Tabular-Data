Three main data problems are emphasized in this work, Missing Semantics(a needed column missed), Inconsistent Value(values appears in different forms in a certain column) and Irrelevant column. AutoPrep decomposes the data prep process into three stages: planning stage, programming stage and executing stage. Planner will generate an SQL-like Analysis Sketch similar to Binder(ICLR'23), outlining how the table should be transformed to produce the answer. In programming stage, Programmer agents translate a high-level logical plan into a physical plan by generating low-level code, which is then passed to an Executor agent for code execution and interactive debugging. One should note all those processings are online. |
| SIGMOD'25   | Pneuma: Leveraging LLMs for Tabular Data Representation and Retrieval in an End-to-End System | Raul Castro Fernandez  |   [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09207) | `TP` | Pneuma system is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to efficiently discover tabular data. It does not only consider the table content information but also the context information. The system will firstly utilize LLM's knowledge to normalize provide meaningful column descriptions, even for abbreviations or domain-specific terms that may be challenging for humans or smaller models to interpret. Then, it use embedding model to generate vector representation of the table with context. In retrieval stage, the system will retrieves tables based on the user query ùëÑ by integrating three signals: lexical (BM25), semantic (vector search), and a signal based on LLM judgment. |

Planner decomposes the query into several sequential subtasks, each of them could be done by either SQL or LLM. And a secondary LLM is assigned to verify the initial plan. Following planning, the Weaver executes the plan sequentially, combining SQL queries and LLM-generated prompts. In the final pipeline stage, the intermediate table and user query are inputted to an LLM, which generates a natural language answer.|

Then, it generates code to pull out the data rows and columns relevant to the query, along with performing necessary operations like filtering or calculations. Next, an external tool runs this code to get accurate results, preventing the model from making up information. These results are then presented clearly. Finally, the model uses its reasoning ability to analyze these results and derive the final answer to the query. For large tables that exceed token limits, the pipeline first compresses them by identifying and keeping only the most relevant data, while adding back potentially useful information to ensure key details aren‚Äôt lost, before proceeding with the above steps.
